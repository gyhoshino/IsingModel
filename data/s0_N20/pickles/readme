This directory contains Python3 pickles of run output for various temperatures.
The name of each pickle is the set and temperature:
    exmaple:
        s0_2.3.pickle for the first time T=2.3 was run
        s1_2.3.pickle for the second time T=2.3 was run
        etc...
The pickle contians either summaries of the EM and Spin Correlation data,
or the full EM and spin corr data sets.

These objects can be unpickled by Python and compiled into CSV files.
Use the Python script unpickle_to_csv.py to do this.
