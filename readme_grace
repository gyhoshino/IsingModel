A couple of things to know on Grace:

1. You should check out your own interactive node and not abuse the logon node.
   Do this with a command like:
   `srun --pty --x11 -c 2 -p interactive -t 6:00:00 bash`

2. The python modeles to run the code can be uploaded into the Grace environment by
   `source grace_env.sh`

3. Run the code with python3 run_ising.py [arguments]....

4. Submit to slurm via sbatch slurm.input. *Note* if you are not using 
   multiprocess:true on slurm on slurm, *be sure* to use curses:false.
   (Curses is a module, named for cursor, which controls the output, but
   Grace will not be happy using it with the graphical output.)
